# Mini E-Commerce

Mini E-Commerce is a **Spring Boot** application that serves as the back-end for a simple online store. It features user registration, product management, a shopping cart system, and order processing. The API is built with a clean layered architecture, leveraging Spring Data JPA for database operations and exposing RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with a front-end. This project demonstrates how to implement key features of an e-commerce system, such as:

- **User management**: Register, update, and delete users.
- **Product management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve products.
- **Shopping cart**: Persist items in the cart, manage quantities, and calculate totals.
- **Order placement**: Handle order creation, manage stock levels, and track order statuses.
